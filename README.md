**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **More keyboard and key types sounds:** Make available for more keyboards(how?), and key-type sounds(where to find?)
- **Add Themes with bgm:** Like mellow, rain, whitenoise, etc
- **Add more sounds and key customizations:** Unique key sounds, individual key/key-category to sound(wasd, arrow_keys, numbers, alpha, symbols, enter, delete, etc)
- **Multiple presets:** Let users save multiple presets.
- **Maybe a themes curation:** A small collection can be made as default options: glass keys, keyboard/piano, guitar, drums, chips, electricity, etc.
